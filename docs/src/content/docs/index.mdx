## Why Inertia?

Building modern web apps usually means choosing between two painful options:

1. **Traditional server-rendered apps** - Simple to build, but feel sluggish without the smooth transitions of an SPA
2. **Single-page applications** - Great UX, but now you need to build an API, handle auth on both ends, manage client-side state, and deal with two separate codebases

Inertia offers a third way. You keep your server-side routing, controllers, and data fetching exactly as you'd build a traditional web app. But instead of rendering HTML views, you render React, Vue, or Svelte components. The result is a fully client-side rendered SPA that feels instant, without any of the API complexity.

## Why inertigo?

**inertigo** brings Inertia.js to Go developers. If you're building web apps with Go and want the modern SPA experience without the overhead of building and maintaining a separate API, this is for you.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="No API Required" icon="rocket">
		Render React/Vue/Svelte components directly from your Go handlers. No REST endpoints, no GraphQL schemas, no duplicated validation logic.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Works With Any Router" icon="puzzle">
		Use the standard library, Chi, Gorilla, Echo, Fiber - inertigo is just middleware that works with any `http.Handler`.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Server-Side Rendering" icon="laptop">
		Built-in SSR support with QuickJS. Get fast initial page loads and proper SEO without a Node.js server.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Type-Safe Props" icon="approve-check">
		Your Go structs become your component props. Catch errors at compile time, not in production.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

Here's what building with inertigo looks like:

```go
func (h *Handler) ShowUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    user, _ := h.db.GetUser(r.PathValue("id"))
    
    h.inertia.Render(w, r, "users/Show", inertia.Props{
        "user": inertia.Value(user),
    })
}
```

That's it. No JSON marshaling, no API versioning, no separate frontend data fetching. Your React component receives the `user` prop directly from your Go code.
